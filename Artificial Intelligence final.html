    <h2><u>Welcome to my AI Website</u></h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field of computer science that focuses on creating machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is being used in a variety of industries, from healthcare and finance to manufacturing and transportation. The potential benefits of AI are enormous, including increased efficiency, improved accuracy, and reduced costs.
      <br>However, there are also concerns about the impact of AI on society, particularly in areas such as privacy, ethics, and job displacement. As AI becomes more advanced and capable of performing increasingly complex tasks, it is important for society to consider the implications of this technology and to develop strategies for managing its use.
      <br>In this website, I will explore the different types of AI, their applications in various fields, the ethical concerns associated with AI, and much more.
      <br>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find the information here informative and useful.</p>
