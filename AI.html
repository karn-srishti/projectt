		<h2>What is AI?</h2>
		<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be divided into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general or strong AI, which is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.</p>
